# Cohort-Chario-EDA-Capstone-Project
<b>This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. </b>

## <b> Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as :
* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it? </b>

# **Conclusion:-**

*From the entire analysis, it can be concluded that*

⮚	Most visitors don’t prefer shared rooms, they tend to visit private room or entire home.

⮚ We can conclude that throughout NewYork city there is a larger preference towards Entire apt as compared to private or shared rooms irrespective to the prices.

⮚	Most of the people perfer to stay in Manhattan and Brooklyn where as least like place is staten island and Bronx.

⮚	Though location of property has high relation on deciding its price, but a property in popular location doesn’t mean it will stay occupied in most of the time.

⮚	Performing a regression on this dataset may result in high error rate, as the features given in this dataset, are of very poor quality in deciding the property valuation. We can see this by looking at correlation heatmap. We would need more features like bedrooms, bathroom, property age (guessed it’d be a very important one), tax rate applicable on land, room extra amenities, distance to nearest hospital, stores or schools. These features might have a high relation with price.
